Quiz Master is a Quiz game I made using HTML, PHP, CSS and Java Script.
The quiz contains a various of question from different topics aiming to challenge the user.
The website features different functionalities, signing up and logging in with validation of the data.
For the input validation I have used regular expressions for correct email form, the password to include digits and letters and the correct form of mobile phone number. If the user does not put the right from of data a message will come up guiding them for the error.
The quiz functionalities: 
The user has to press start to start the quiz, then a random question will come up with 4 possible answers so the user has to pick one then submit answer to the next question and go on until the quiz finishes, when the user selects an answer it tell whether it was right or wrong  for red its wrong and for green itâ€™s the right answer, finally  at the end of the quiz  the user will get their score.
The game also features relaxing music in the background for focus and cool colour combinations of my choice for the website and the game.
The leader board works and functions but not as perfect however it works for a user per log in and it stores their records in the table.
 Below this report I will be attaching a screenshot of each of the pages of the website.
